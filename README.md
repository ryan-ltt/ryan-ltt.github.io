# website-build
i want a blog and a place to put my thoughts about my experiences in the world. i want to build a website that displays what i think the internet and the web should be, which is an online space for human beings to share their thoughts with other human beings.

i like a minimalistic website, not one with bloat that takes an insanely long time to load. surely if it's just a blog it should load immediately in 2026...

everything is going to be messy for a bit, but i will figure it out eventually :p

i also dont want to pay for hosting, thus why i am using github pages. i may buy my own domain eventually, but i dont think that is necessary at the moment.
